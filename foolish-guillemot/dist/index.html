# Some global variables
# = UnitCell =
# (these only work under "node")
#  - x, y:     unitcell coordinates scaled between 0 and 1. 
#              useful when combined with scale, as in s(x, 0.3, 0.5)
#  - x_i, y_i: unitcell coordinates as integers (useful for mod)
#  - seed:   a "random" seed for the cell. can be useful for rn(seed, 3)
#
# = Global =
# == Time ==
#  - t:       time in seconds
#  - tease:   a bouncing thing between 0 and 1. can be useful with scale.
#  - stease:  like tease but slow
#
# == App ==
#  - mx, my:  mouse position
#  - cx, cy:  last click position
#  - w, h:    drawing window dimensions
#  - click:   is currently clicking
#
# == Functions ==
# this includes all of the functions from https://github.com/ISibboI/evalexpr?tab=readme-ov-file#builtin-functions
# and some bonus ones
#  - clamp(x, 0, 1)
#
# Some gotchas:
# - you're either writing in YAML or in evalexpr. This leads to a few (non-ideal) things:
#   - YAML uses # for comments and evalexpr uses //
#   - a mistake at the YAML will give you a nice message, while in evalexpr it'll silently fail
#
#
# This is a rough draft of a demo, so might disappear or change at any time!
